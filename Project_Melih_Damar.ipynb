    "\n",
    "Even though institutions are always present in the economic theory, it is generally incleduded implicitly. Most of the early economic modes assumes a set of institutions such as property right of factors of production or ownershio of some assets in economics. However, the the effect of institutions on economic growth was left wasn't paid more attention to examine. However, it is difficult to build a model to obtain convincing result about the relationships of institutions with other economic variable as institutions are generally exogenous and they are mostly related with other factors which are affecting economic performance of a nation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently,there has been an attempt to find different methods to be able to control to pure effect of institutions which are treated as an exogenous variable. Acemoglu et al.(2001) used historically determined factors to obtain exogenous measure of institutions. They suggest that during colonization of New World, Europens brought different type of institutions from their countries based on certain characteristics of the colonized regions. At one extreme sitution, they form extractive institutions in such a way to transfer resources to Europe, which was the reason for the formation of economic institutions which led to the creation of rules enabling slavery, discrimation, monopolies and insecure property rights. Most of the African countries is an example for this type of institutions. At the other extreme situtation, European colonizers settled down to the colonized region and brought European institutions, which contibute more to sustainable economic development. The decision whether to settle down or not was based on the mortality rate of European settlers. If the mortality rate of settlers were high, they constituted more extractive institutions whereas they formed better institutions which were so similar to , even sometimes better than European laws in colonies where mortality rate is low enough to settle down. After the independence of the old colonies, these institutions persisted to exist. Therefore, Acemoglu et al.(2001) argued that the mortality rate of early European colonizers can be used as an instrumental variable for the current institutions of the countries beacuse the mortality rate was determined exogonously and randomly which has no direct effect on current development sitution of a country. The following diagram can show this relations;\n",

    "    \n",
    "   \n",
    "Acemoglu et al.(2014) used two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression model where log GDP per capita 2005 was the dependent variable and protection against the risk of expropriation, as a measure of current instutions, was the main explanatory variable instrumented by logarithm of settlers mortality rate. Even further, Acemoglu et al.(2012) used capped potential settler mortality rate as an alternative instrumental variable. The results demonstrate that instutions have a large effect on long-run economic development of a country with both of the formulation of instrumental variable, accounting 75% of difference between high and low institutions countries. Moreover, these results were robust to controlling various geographical characteristics of a country that could be correlated with the economic development. The authors didn't control for the proximate determinants of economic development in the framework defined by North&Thomas(1973) as the channel instutions affect economic growth of a country is the proximate determinants and controlling for them would lead to a \"bad control\" as Angrist & Pischke(2008) suggested.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework suggested by Acemoglu(2001) was challenged by Glaeser et al.(2004) for putting institutions before human capital. They suggested that, on the contary to Acemoglu et al(2001), European settlers brought human capital and the places they brought more human capital constitute more organized and better societies which enabled them to experience economic developmnet."

    "In this article, Acemoglu et al.(2014) has there main contribution in terms of evaluating the the impact of human capital and institutions on the economic performance of a country. The first main contribution is to give a brief historical explanation about the human capital European colonizers brought to their colonies in order to show that, on the contray to what Glaeser et al.(2004) suppose, more human capital was brouught to the extractive colonies than inclusive colonies, which means the main reason for the differences in economic development of early colonized countries is not the human capital they brought rather the institutions which supports mass schooling. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second main contribution of this paper is that when they treat human capital as an exogenous variable or instrument with early Protestant missionary activities, the estimate is 25-35%, which is similar to the results of Glaeser et al.(2004) whereas when they control the human capital and historical determinants of institutions or simultaneously treat them as endogenous variables the impact of human capital on economic development is estimated closer to Mincerian evidence (contribution of one more year of schooling on individual earnings) as 6-10%, which is less than what Galeaser et. al.(2004) estimated. The authours suggested that the main reason why these two numbers are different is omitted variables whose effect is captured by human capital and they think that it is institutions. This results suggest that instituions have effect on long-run development through human capital channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third contribution is that they investigated the effect of human capital on long-run development by using a cross-regional data and they concluded that the huge inequalities between region is correlated with the educational background of the inhabitants of the regions. They found the results similar to the second contribution when they treat the human capital seperately as an exogenous variable and endogonous variable instrumented with Protestant missionary activities. \n",

    "Colonization of New World with Europens created not only different types of institutions in colonized countries but also variation in human capital brought by early colonizers. Glaeser et al.(2004) argued that the variation in economic developments of former colonies of European countries was created by the difference in human capital they brought not the instutitons. However, historical evidences suggest that the conquistadors who colonized South America was more educated than the ones who colonized the North America, which is the opposite of what Glaeser et al.(2004) suggested. Based on the work of Avellaneda(1995), average literacy of the conquistadors in five different expeditions to South America was 78.7%. The main reasons were that early colonizers of South America came from urban areas in Spain and they were mostly second or thirs sons of nobles who could not inherit any land under Spanish law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though they were highly educated people amoong the early colonizers of North America, they consitute the small portion of people who migrated the North America. Grubb(1990) exploited the jury list to come up with a literacy rate and the figures suggest that the literacy rate of colonizers of North America in Virginia was 54% in the 1600s.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we looked at the literacy and education level in nineteenth century, North America was better than South America. However, this doesn't has nothing to do with the level of human capital they brough when they first settled down. Instead, it has everything to do with the institution they created, which increased the investment in human capital and school construction.\n",
    "To sum up, historical evidences don't provide support to the idea that the differences in countries' economic development level is because of the variation in human capital they brought when they first settled rather than institutions they formed. "

    "In this paper, the purpose of Acemoglu et al.(2014) is to investigate the relationship between human capital, institutions and economic prosperity of a country as previous literature which treat both institutions and human capital as exogenous suggest a higher return of human capital on development than Mincerian estimates. The authors beleive that the literature suffers from omitted variable bias problems and differential measurement error in these variables. To eliminate this problem, the authors instrumented human capital with historically determined variables and controled for the effect of institutions on human capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "The casual graph below illustrates the relationship between main variables suggested by Acemoglu et al.(2014). While the main determinants of log GDP per capita is institutions and human capital, institutions have effect on the path of human capital development of a country through supporting mass schooling policies. For instance, the reason why the US has more educated population than Mexico or Peru is not beause of human capital brought by early colonizer, rather, it is because of the instutitons they brought. Moreover, population density in 1500 and early settlers mortality rate affect log GDP per capita not directly but through institutions while Prostestant missionaries in the early 20th century and primary enrollment rate in 1900 has an impact on log GDP per capita through human capital. Thus, as it can be seen from the casual graph, there is a back-door path which needs to closed to see the true effect of human capital on economic prosperity. Moreover, we can not condition on human capital to see the true effect of institutions on log GDP per capita because human capital is descendent of institutions. Also, as current institutions is an endogenous variable in the economic development process of a country, in other word, institutions can be coorelated with some unobservable error term $(U_{1})$, Acemoglu et al.(2014) implement instrumental variable approach to isolate exogenous part of institutions by using historically determined variation. The same logic also applies to human capital variable. \n",

    "The authors' main source of potentially exogenous variation in human capital is Protestant missionary activities per 10.000 people in the early twentieth century. They use two different data. During all the analysis, a dummy variable will be added to indicate that a different source of information for Protestant missionary activities is used. One can argue that missionary activities are excludable from regressions of economic development for the following reason. First, the location of missionary activities was clearly chosen. Second, missionary activities in French and British colonies were different as well as across different continents. Third, missionary activity might have affected the evolution of some instutitons such as emergence of democracy or schooling system. Fourth, missionary activity might have influenced long-run development by affecting the current religious composition of the population. However, by controlling continent dummies , the identity of the colonial power and institutions, the allocatio of missionary activities across and within countries may be a candidate for insturmental variable for human capital. The average value of Protestant missionary activities per 10.000 people is  0.46.\n",

    "In **[Table 2](#table_2)**, various OLS regressions are run to present the correlation between economic development today (measured by GDP per capita in 2005) and measures of human capital and institutions. The sample consists of 62 former colonized countries for which there is data. Heteroscedasticity robust standard errors are shown in parantheses. In the first column, the results belong to the regression of years of schooling on log GDP per capita in 2005. The relationship between them is significant with a coefficient of 0.352. The coefficient is very large. **[Figure 1-A](#figure_1)** plots the log of GDP per capita in 2005 against years of schooling. The red line is the fitted values from column . Considering the fact that the coefficient of years of schooling should match with the coefficient estimated with Mincer equation (generally estimated to be between 0.06 and 0.10) with an elastic supply of capital, no externalities and no omitted variable bias, the huge difference between coefficients suggests that there are omitted variable bias as the huge human capital externalities weren't supported by existing literature. Column 2 shows the relationship between the rule of law and log GDP per capital. There is a strong correlation between them with a coefficient of 0.930. **[Figure 1-B](#figure_1)** plots the log of GDP per capita in 2005 against the rule of law index. The red line is the fitted values from column 2. Column 3 consists of the result of regression with years of schooling and the rule of law as explanatory variables. The coefficient of the rule of law significantly decreases whereas the effect of years of schooling slightly decreases, which is still relatively higher than Mincerian estimate.\n",
    "Other columns shows the result of regressions with different combination of control variables. The control variables are latitute( absolute value of distance from the country to the equator), dummy variables for the continent of Africa, America, Asia where Australasia is the omitted group, and dummies for British and French colonies where other European countries are omitted variables. The motivating reason why there are control variables for countries are that they may have had different institutions, human capital policies and different types of missionary activities. The control variables have a small impact on the result. Even though the column 12 includes all the control variables, there is small decrease in years of schooling.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some potential problems in the results. The first reasons is the possible differential measurement error in human capital and institutions.Because human capital is partly determined by institutions and correlated with them (**[Figure 1- C](#figure_1)**), some of the effects of institutions on log GDP per capita will be loaded on to human capital, which means upward bias in the estimates of human capital and downward bias in the estimates of institutions. This problem can be corrected by including instrumental variable into our model. Second, there might be a reverse causality between human capital and log GDP per capita.Higher income might lead to higher schooling level.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, even though there is a correlation between human capital and institutions, and economic development of a country, these cannot be seen as a casual relation beacuse of possible omitted variable problem."

The authors used a sample with 24 countries in which missionary activity started after 1870.

The coefficient of Protestant missionary activities in the early twentieth century significantly increases compared to the estimates in columns 1-4, showing stronger correlation between primary school enrollment in 1940 and Protestant missionary activities. In column 8 where latitude, colonizer identity and continent dummies are controlled, the coefficient of the Protestant missionary variable is significant at the 10% significance level.

There are some variable which are not included in this table like Anderson-Rubin confidence intervals,and F-statistic excluded instruments. In the first part of the table is the second stage of the two stage least square regression and the second part is the first stage of the regression.

Column 1 includes the result from a regression which includes only average years of schooling and dummy variable for different sourcs of protestant missionary data in both first and second stage. It doesn't include any historically determinant variable. The results show a strong fist-stage relationship as instrumental varibles except dummies are statistically significant.

As a result, if the estimates in columns 1-4 were the casual effect of human capital on log GDP per capital, the effect again would be significantly higher than the micro estimates, which might be because the models do not control for the effect of institutions even though they are instrumented with historical variation in human capital today. \n",

The dependent variable is the log GDP per capita at the regional level. All spesifications include country fixed effects. Column 1 , as always, is the simplest spesification with only years of schooling as an explanatory variable. In this spesification, the sample contains 1495 observations to verify that the baseline results for 684 regions are similar to the results in the larger sample. The coeffcient estimated on years of schooling is 0.282 (which is simiar to the ones in **[Table 2](#table_2)**) and statistically significant. The column 2 present the same spesification with the base sample with 684 observations and it has almost the same result. The rest of the columns include various control variables. In column 3-5 controls for capital cities ( which might be richer), two variables for inverse distance to coast ( to capture the idea that more isolated regions are poorer), a dummy for landlocked regions and two temperature variables. In the last column, population density of the region before colonization is controlled. Addition of all control variables barely change the results."

    "In this section, average years of schooling is instrumentad with the presence of  Protestant missions in the early twentieth century at the regional level. The results of 2SLS are presented in **[Table 10](#table_10)**. The table presented here is a little bit different than the original paper. There are some variables that are not shown here such as F-statistic excluded instruments and Kleibergen & Paap (2006) test. The first half of the table presents the second-stage regression results while the bottom half is the results from firs-stage regressions. All spesifications have country fixed effect. Column 1 has the basic spesification where the regression has only years of schooling as an explanatory variable and the presence of Protestant missionary as an instrumental variable. The spesification has a strong first-stage relationship, however, the second-stage shows that once years of schoolings is instrumented, its magnitude (0.203) decrases towards to micro estimates compared to the corresponding coefficient in **[Table 9](#table_9)**. For the remaning columns, the models have the same control variables as in **[Table 9](#table_9)**. Addition of control variables make the coefficient of years of schooling is statistically insignificant and decrease its magnitude.\n",

    "To conclude, once human capital today is instrumented with the presence of Protestant missionary activities in the early twentieth century along with addition of various control variable, the magnitude of human capital on GDP per capital today falls from high levels to levels more close to micro estimates. The main difference from the cross-country evidence is that in cross-region evidence, instrumenting for differences in human capital is sufficient to achieve this result, whereas in the cross-country models, controlling for institutions is also necessary, which probably means that protestant missionary activity is not a valid source of variation unless we control for institutions at the country level, but conditional on country fixed effects, it provides a more plausible source of variation in within-country variation in human capital"

    "In this paper, Acemoglu et al.(2014) uses average years of schooling of the population above age 15 in 2005 as a measure of human capital today to explain the relationship between human capital, institutions and economic development. Even though years of schooling is widely used in the literature to investigate the effect of human capital on various variables such as income and health, years of schooling is a quantity-based measure. It doesn't give us a full picture about the effect of schooling as it excludes quality of the education because schooling is not the same as learning. As a measure of human capital, years of schooling assumes that one more year spent in the school has the same impact on the development of human capital both in the USA and Chile. However, international assessments of educational attainment such as Programme for Interational Student Assessment(PISA),Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) reveal that there are discrepancies in the levels of cognitive skills of students at the same age (For PISA,age 15 and for TIMSS, $8^{th}$ grade) even if they have the same amount of years of schooling. Another concern is differences in adults who has completed the same amount of schooling. For example, comparing young adults from Nigeria and Tanzania whom have completed only primary education shows literacy rates of 19 and 80 percent respectively (Kaffenberger and Pritchett,2017).  Therefore, I decided to use another variable,called learning-adjusted years of schooling (LAYS) -proposed by Angrist et al.(2018)- as a proxy of human capital which also captures the quality of education to test the robustness of results presented in the paper.\n",

My benchmark country is the country with the highest score, which means $R_{c}^{n}$ is less than 1 for every country except benchmark country. More precisely\n",

    "    \n",
    "In addition to change in one of the explanatory variable, I will change the year of data to investigate the relationship with newer data. The authors uses data from 2015 and I will use data from 2017. In this exercise, my explanatory variable is the log of GD per capita (purchasing power parity(PPP) basis) in 2017 from the PennWorld Tables. My explanatory variable for human capital is Learning-adjested years of schooling from World Bank [Human Capital Index](#human_capital_index) dataset which is calculated by multiplying the estimates of expected years of school by the ratio of most recent harmonized test scores to 625 and the rule of law index. My indicator for current institutions is the rule of law index for 2017 from the [Worldwide Governance Indicators](#wgi) constructed by the World Bank. I aim to get more precise and significant results for the effect of human capital on economic development,so I will replicate the results of [Table 4](#table_4), [Table 5](#table_5) and [Table 6](#table_6) by using learning-adjusted years of schooling instead of average years of schooling as it is the core of the paper. \n",

    "[Table 11](#table_11) is similar to [Table 4](#table_4).The results belong to models in which learning-adjusted years of schooling is treated as endogenous variable instrumented with the same instruments in the paper; Protestant missionary activity in the early twentieth century and primary school enrollment in 1900. Here I only presented the second stage results to save space. Column 1-4 presents the results of second-stage regression of learning-adjusted years of schooling on the log GDP per capita in 2017 with our usual control variables. In column 5-8 has the same spesification however, this time I include historically determined control variables for institutions. My results are similar to the results in [Table 4](#table_4). In columns 1-4, without controlling variables for institutions, the coefficients of LAYS are signigicant whereas after controlling for historical variables of institutions, the magnitude of coefficient decreases and they become insignificant."

In the first three columns, the explanatory variable ( X in equation (2)) is LAYS, while it is years of schooling in the last three columns. In columns 1 and 4, the insturmental variable is Protestant missionary activities in the early twentieth century, whereas primary enrollment rate in 1900 is the only instrumental variable for columns 2 and 5. In addition, Columns 3-6 shows the result from model including both insturmental variable. The p-values for primary enrollment rate is always higher than the significance level (0.05), so we fail to rejecet null hypothesis of no measurement error, which means it is possible that $\\overline{\\gamma}$ is equal to zero as expected. However, when we use Protestant missionary activities for instrumental variable, we reject the null hypothesis of no measurement error for LAYS in column 1 in significance level of 0.05 and 0.10 (0.035<0.05 and 0.035<0.10), and in column 3 with significance level of 0.10 (0.063<0.10). To conclude, learning-adjusted years of schooling is an error-contaminated variable and it might be one of the reason why my results of 2SLS in [Table 13](#table_13) is insignificant. This exercises gives me some insight about why the authors do not use LAYS as a proxy for human capital today."
